Installation instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Create an anaconda environment exclusive to the package. Create it with Python 3.11.5 or 3.11.9.
3. Activate the environment.
4. Open terminal (on OS) or Anaconda terminal (on PC), and navigate to the root of the cloned repository.
5. Exectute >pip install -e .
6. Check that the dependencies were correctly installed by opening one of the analysis notebooks in your favorite Jupyter Notebook compatible development tool and running the import cell.

Recommendations:
- Use Anaconda-Navigator to install Spyder with Spyder-notebook and use it to interact with the analysis notebooks. There are more tools provided by Spyder than with by the basic Jupyter Server. The variable explorer offered by Spyder is very good for debugging analysis, in particular.
